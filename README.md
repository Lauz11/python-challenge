# python-challenge
In this challenge, we tackled two Python tasks: PyBank and PyPoll. For PyBank, we delved into the financial records of a company, analyzing a dataset to extract insights such as the total number of months covered, the overall profit or loss, the average change in profits each month, and the largest increase and decrease in profits. In this challenge, we had to analyze a dataset for PyPoll, where we focused on a small town's voting process. We delved into the voting information, aiming to determine the total number of votes cast, compile a list of candidates who received votes, calculate the percentage of votes each candidate garnered, and declare the winner of the election both of them in Phyton.
